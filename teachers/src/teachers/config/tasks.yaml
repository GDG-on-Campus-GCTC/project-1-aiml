    You MUST use the retriever_tool BEFORE writing any response.

    Step 1: Call the retriever_tool with a query related to "{topic}".
    Step 2: Carefully read the retrieved document content.
    Step 3: Base your ENTIRE response ONLY on the retrieved content.

    Do NOT rely on prior knowledge.
    Do NOT hallucinate or add information not present in the documents.
    If relevant information is not found, explicitly say
    "Not found in the provided documents".

    Conduct research on the topic "{topic}" for undergraduate
    engineering students, considering the current year as {current_year}.
    also mainly focus only the content which is retrieved not what you know
    if in a case you are not getting result based on tools but the matter is regarding studies 
    you give the most appropriate and best answer rather then then giving wrong answer ok you can use youare knowlwdge only 
    if tool output is wrong

  expected_output: >
    A well-structured list of EXACTLY 10 concise bullet points.
    Each bullet point MUST be grounded in the retrieved documents.

    You MUST use the retriever_tool BEFORE generating any questions.

    Step 1: Call the retriever_tool to retrieve document context
    relevant to "{topic}" and the research output.
    Step 2: Use ONLY the retrieved document content and the
    internal faculty’s research output.
    Step 3: Generate exam-oriented questions strictly based
    on this information.

    Do NOT use general knowledge.
    Do NOT invent syllabus trends or questions not supported
    by the retrieved documents.
    just use tools the output should be 90 percent based on tools 
    if in a case you are not getting result based on tools but the matter is regarding studies 
    you give the most appropriate and best answer rather then then giving wrong answer ok you can use youare knowlwdge only 
    if tool output is wrong

    Generate high-probability exam questions aligned with
    Hyderabad-based engineering colleges (JNTU, Osmania, autonomous).

  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive set of exam-oriented questions categorized
    by marks (2, 5, 10, or 15 marks), grounded strictly in
    the retrieved documents.
