    YOU MUST USE the retriever_tool BEFORE writing any response.

    MANDATORY PROCESS:
    Step 1: Call the retriever_tool with a query related to "{topic}".
    Step 2: Carefully read and understand the retrieved document content.
    Step 3: Write your response based STRICTLY on the retrieved content.

    STRICT CONTENT RULES:
    - Do NOT rely on prior knowledge.
    - Do NOT hallucinate or invent information.
    - Do NOT add facts that are not present in the retrieved documents.
    - If required information is NOT found, explicitly state:
      "Not found in the provided documents".

    FALLBACK RULE (VERY IMPORTANT):
    - Use your own general knowledge ONLY IF:
        a) The retriever_tool returns no content, OR
        b) The retrieved content is clearly incorrect or misleading.
    - This fallback must be used ONLY to avoid giving a wrong academic answer.

    TASK OBJECTIVE:
    - Conduct research on "{topic}" for undergraduate engineering students.
    - Consider the current academic year as {current_year}.
    - Focus mainly and preferably ONLY on retrieved content.
    - Do NOT generate questions.
    - Provide ONLY conceptual/theoretical information.

  expected_output: >
    A well-structured list of EXACTLY 10 concise bullet points.
    Each bullet point MUST be grounded in the retrieved documents
    (unless the fallback rule is explicitly triggered).

    YOU MUST USE the retriever_tool BEFORE generating any output.

    MANDATORY PROCESS:
    Step 1: Call the retriever_tool to retrieve document content
            relevant to "{topic}".
    Step 2: Review both:
            a) Retrieved document content, and
            b) Internal faculty’s research output.
    Step 3: Decide the response mode STRICTLY based on user intent.

    RESPONSE DECISION RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
    - If the user EXPLICITLY asks for:
        "important questions", "exam questions", "probable questions",
        "long answer questions", "short answer questions":
        → Generate ONLY exam-oriented questions.
    - If the user asks for concepts, explanations, or theory:
        → Explain the concept clearly.
        → DO NOT generate any questions.

    CONTENT RESTRICTIONS:
    - Use ONLY retrieved document content and internal research output.
    - Do NOT invent syllabus trends or unsupported questions.
    - Do NOT use general knowledge by default.

    FALLBACK RULE:
    - Use general knowledge ONLY IF:
        a) retriever_tool returns no useful data, OR
        b) retrieved data is academically incorrect.
    - Use fallback ONLY to avoid giving a wrong study-related answer.

    ACADEMIC ALIGNMENT:
    - Align content with Hyderabad-based engineering colleges
      (JNTU, Osmania, Autonomous).

    QUALITY REQUIREMENT:
    - At least 90% of the final output must be based on tool results.
    - Never mix theory explanations with question lists.

  expected_output: >
    If questions are requested:
    - A structured set of exam-oriented questions categorized by
      2, 5, 10, or 15 marks, grounded in retrieved documents.

    If theory is requested:
    - A clear, student-friendly conceptual explanation
      with NO questions included.
